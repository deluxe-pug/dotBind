This is the postgres adapter for Any-DB. It relies on the [pg.js][] database
driver to create [Connection][] and [Query][] objects that conform to the
[Any-DB API][]. The API is practically identical to that of `require('pg')`
but allows your app code to be portable between databases.

## API extensions

The connections and queries this package creates inherit from [pg.Client][]
and [QueryStream][], so any methods described there are also available to you.

Keep in mind that these methods will *not* necessarily work with other backends.

## Install

    npm install any-db-postgres
